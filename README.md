fukigen sou na kimi to sugoshite
wakatta koto ga hitotsu aru yo
sonna furi shite tatakau koto ni hisshi
itsumademo kaenai de koori no you ni
natsu no hizashi atsuku temo tokezu ni ite ne
kitto sakini utsukushii hyouga ga aru yo
katachi aru sonna kokoro daredatte kizukeba motteru kimi mo motteru

Passing the time with you when you're in a bad mood,
There's one thing that I've learned.
You're just pretending to be like that and desperately fighting.
Don't ever change like the ice does.
Even if the summer sun's rays are hot, don't melt away.
I'm sure that just ahead, there's a beautiful glacier.
That kind of heart with a shape – if they'd realize it, all people have them. You have one too!

onakagasuite aruke nakunatte
wakatta koto ga hitotsu aru yo
yaru beki koto sakiokuri ni shite yaritai koto bakka yatteru
gohan tabete tatakau shitaku shiyo
itsumademo mottetai yo hagane no you na
donna mono mo toosanai ganko na iji o
kitto ima mo tachitsukushite mamori no tochuu
yukute ni wa kazoekirenai
teki ga ite atashi o matteru kimi ni mo matteru

Hungry and unable to keep on walking,
There's one thing that I've learned.
I'm putting off the things I should do and just doing what I want.
I'll eat my food and get ready to fight!
I want to have this forever – as strong as steel,
A stubborn spirit that won't let anything through.
I'm sure that even now, it's in the middle of standing still and defending.
On the path ahead, there are countless enemies
That are waiting for me. They're waiting for you, too!

mayotta tokiniwa kokoro no chizu o atashi ni misete hoshii
sorenara yukusaki sugu wakaru kara
jibun ja wakaranai dake

When we're lost, I want you to show me the map in your heart.
In that case, we'll know the way to go soon.
I just can't figure it out alone.

saa sa susumou ikutsumono kakehashi
itsumademo issho dakara koibito no you ni
natsu no hizashi atsuku temo hanarezu iru ne
kitto sakini soudai na keshiki ga matsu yo
sonotoki wa tamatte ita sono kimochi zenbu kiite yaru
atashi mo motteru kimi ni mo kikasu tappuri kikasu

Come on, let's move ahead across any number of bridges.
We'll always be together like lovers,
So even if the summer sun's rays are hot, we won't be apart.
I'm sure that just ahead, a magnificent landscape awaits.
When that time comes, I'll listen to all of those feelings you've gathered.
I have those too. I'll tell you about them, too. I'll tell them all to you!
